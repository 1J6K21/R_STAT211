x <- c(9, 9, 24, 29, 44, 13, 28, 17, 42, 26, 11, 20, 26, 38, 7, 54) # First store the raw observations as a vector in R

quantile(x, 0.25) #Calculates the first quartile or equivalently the 25th percentile or the 0.25-th quantile

quantile(x, 0.50) #Calculates the second quartile (the median) or equivalently the 50th percentile or the 0.50-th quantile

quantile(x, 0.75) #Calculates the third quartile or equivalently the 75th percentile or the 0.75-th quantile

min(x) #Calculates the minimum observation

max(x) #Calculates the maximum observation

mean(x) #Calculates the sample mean or the sample average

sd(x) #Calculates the sample standard deviation

var(x) #Calculates the sample variance

Hope the above clarification helps.
